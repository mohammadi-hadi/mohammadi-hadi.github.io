		<p>Scientific research is the cornerstone of progress and innovation, but the traditional methods of conducting research and sharing findings have been criticized for their lack of transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility. In recent years, a growing movement has emerged that seeks to address these shortcomings and promote a more open and collaborative approach to scientific research. This movement is known as "openscience", and it has gained momentum around the world as more researchers, institutions, and governments embrace its principles. In this article, I will explore the motivations behind the open science movement and highlight the efforts of the Netherlands and Utrecht University in advancing open science practices. By shedding light on the importance of open science and the progress made in this area, I hope to inspire more researchers and institutions to embrace open science practices and contribute to a more transparent, collaborative, and innovative scientific community.
